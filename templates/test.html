{Greeting} Project Team:

Please review the case below.

The user, {User Role} {User Name} {User Email} has requested that (Number of/All Tests)  test opportunities be moved from an incorrect EK to new EK (Correct EK number) .

The Results ID to be moved are from the (current, SYdate-date) test administration.

Incorrect EK: (Required, can we lock this so they can't use a Student ID Length?)

RID to be Moved:  (Required, Results ID to be moved number will vary, can you add field when field has been added? That's an interesting way to do it. If I add number, another field populates to be filled)

Correct EK:(Required, can we lock this so they can't use a Student ID Length?)

Thank you for your time and attention to this case.

 
Respectfully,
